# Donor Tracking DApp

Created basic DApp with Solidity in this project. First I created owner and owner can do check own balance and can do withdraw. After I finish owner process, I created struct of Donor for donors features(like name, address, amount and timestamp). The donor can do just sends ETH in this project.

## Features
- Owner can do check own ETH balance.
- Owner can withdraw.
- Donors can donate ETH, thank's to 'transfer' function.
- Can be displayed all donor information.
- Kept donor information in 'struct' .
- Every donation process is logged with 'event' .
